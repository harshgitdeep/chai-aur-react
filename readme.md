## THESE ARE MY PRESONAL NOTES FOR THIS ENTIRE COURSE:
<p>Might be useful</p>

React latest documentation ---> https://react.dev/

React library  React-DOM (for websites)
               React-native (for mobile applications)

================================================================= <br>
### Ways to create react app - 

npm (Node Package Manager) used for installing and managing Node.js packages, 
npx (Node Package Executer) is a tool used to execute Node.js packages directly, without the need for installation.

==

#### METHOD 1: npx create-react-app appname (This method is very slow, very bulky)

==

#### METHOD 2: using VITE  (vite -->https://vitejs.dev/)

npm create vite@latest

note: this method is fast, but there is no folder for node modules
      use,   npm i --> to get node modules folder
